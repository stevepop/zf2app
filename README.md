ZF2App
=======================

Introduction
------------
This is App is being built as I get my feet wet with ZF2. I started by installing Zend Framework 2 together with the ZendSkeletonApplication


Installation
------------

Using Composer (recommended)
----------------------------
The recommended way to get a working copy of this project is to clone the repository
and use `composer` to install dependencies using the `create-project` command:

    curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php --
    php composer.phar create-project -sdev --repository-url="http://packages.zendframework.com" zendframework/skeleton-application path/to/install
